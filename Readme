This is a simple Linear Regression with R-squared Calculations and Variance(Optional).
- Created random values for y using random.rand depending on whether or not we want the data points to be correlated.

- Calculated m and b ,where m is the slope of the line which tells you how the line formed by the co-ordinates (x,y) in the graph [M-POSTIVE -line is increasing from left to right M-NEGATIVE - line is decreasing from right to left] ,X is basically range of y  which is from 0 to 39 ,
b is the y intercept which is the point where the line interesects the Y-axis

-Finding R-squared which requres sum of squares of Regression and Sum of squares of Total
--Sum of squares of Regression is the difference between the prediction(predicted y value) and the population mean(mean of y)
--Sum of squares of Total is difference between the dependent value(y given) and its mean

############## FORMULAS ###################
**Linear Reg.- y = mX + b
**m = Slope= Change in x   Mean(X)Mean(y)-Mean(X*y)
	     -----------   -----------------------    
             Change in y   Mean(X)**2 - Mean(X**2)	
**b = y-mX
​	
**Variance - (Sum(X -mean(X))^2)/N 
--where N is the total # of data points [here I haven't used variance formula instead created the data points of y based on variance,you can change the value of variance and thus values of y ,which intern changes the value of R-squared(accuracy)] 

**R-squared is 1-(SSR/SST)
SSR = Sum(ŷ-Mean(y))**2
SST = Sum(y -Mean(y))**2
